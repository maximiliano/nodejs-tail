USAGE

Requirements
Nodejs and npm installed, refer to https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation

Modules express and socket.io installed
# npm install express socket.io

Setup
# git clone git@github.com:maximiliano/nodejs-tail.git
# cd nodejs-tail
# touch log.out

Running
# node app.js
or
# node app.js path/to/file

If no path to a file is passed, the app will assume it is to tail the log.out file in the repository root directory.

Access http://localhost:8081

In a terminal feed log.out (or the one specified) file with new data.
For example:
echo "New data" >> log.out

You will see this data poping in the browser, and in the browser console if you have that open.

That's all there's to it.

USAGE

Requirements
Nodejs installed, refer to https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation

Modules express and socket.io installed
# npm install express socket.io

Running
# node app.js

Access http://localhost:8081

In a terminal feed log.out file with new data.
For example:
echo "New data" >> log.out

You will see this data poping in the browser, and in the browser console if you have that open.

That's all there's to it.
